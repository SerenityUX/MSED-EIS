    <h2>Day 2:</h2>
    <p>I made a wallpaper for my laptop. It's a combination of these little squares I found with a new text: "in life we are always becoming" -- a play on my normal "in life we are always learning"</p>
    <p>It's close to the new year, perhaps this is a new mindset about becoming someone and each day evolving into that person. It acknowledges not just growth but in general the change.</p>

    <h2>Day 1:</h2>
    <p>I made a poster for my apartment. It was stolen from something I found on Pinterest, edited, and printed from a Korean poster-printing website I came across.</p>
